# Flappy Bird Game

## Description
Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive side-scrolling game where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of green pipes without hitting them. The game is known for its challenging gameplay and retro-style graphics. The objective is to fly the bird as far as possible, earning a point for each set of pipes the bird successfully navigates through.

## Gameplay
- **Controls**: Tap or click to make the bird flap its wings and ascend. Gravity will pull the bird downwards when not flapping.
- **Objective**: Navigate through as many sets of pipes as possible without colliding with them.
- **Scoring**: Earn one point for each set of pipes the bird passes through. The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
- **Difficulty**: The game starts easy but quickly becomes challenging as the gap between pipes remains constant, requiring precise timing and control.

## Features
- **Endless Gameplay**: Continue playing as long as you can avoid the pipes.
- **Retro Graphics**: Enjoy the nostalgic pixel-art style reminiscent of early video games.
- **High Score Tracking**: Compete with yourself and others by trying to beat the high score.


Enjoy the game and happy flapping!
